# 0004. Comprehensive Invoice Ninja Documentation Implementation

Date: 2025-01-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The invoiceninja-application repository required comprehensive documentation to enable any engineer to understand what we built, why we built it this way, how to operate it safely, and how to evolve it. The existing documentation was minimal and did not provide sufficient information for operational use or development work.

Based on the issue requirements, we needed to:

1. Research Invoice Ninja from official upstream sources
2. Document the application's purpose, features, and configuration
3. Provide detailed deployment and operational procedures
4. Include troubleshooting guidance for common issues
5. Establish development workflows and customization guidelines

## Decision

We have implemented a comprehensive documentation set under `docs/techdocs/` using MkDocs format, structured as follows:

### Documentation Structure

- **index.md** - Main landing page with navigation and quick start
- **project-overview.md** - Project description and upstream application details
- **upstream-application.md** - Comprehensive Invoice Ninja facts from official sources
- **configuration.md** - Environment variables, volumes, and service settings
- **deployment.md** - Step-by-step deployment and upgrade procedures
- **operations.md** - Day-to-day operational procedures and monitoring
- **troubleshooting.md** - Common issues and their solutions
- **development.md** - Development workflow and customization guidelines

### Information Sources

All documentation is derived from official Invoice Ninja sources verified on 2025-01-09:

- Invoice Ninja Official Documentation (https://invoiceninja.github.io/)
- Invoice Ninja GitHub Repository (https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja)
- Invoice Ninja Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/r/invoiceninja/invoiceninja)
- Laravel Framework Documentation (https://laravel.com/docs/10.x)
- Docker and Docker Compose documentation

### Key Documentation Features

1. **Compliance with Upstream** - All application behavior documented is sourced from and consistent with official upstream documentation
2. **Makefile Integration** - Documentation aligns with the existing Makefile commands and Docker Compose configuration
3. **Image Policy Documentation** - Clear explanation of our organization-built images policy
4. **Environment Variable Coverage** - Complete enumeration of all required and optional environment variables
5. **Volume and Persistence Documentation** - Detailed coverage of data persistence responsibilities
6. **Troubleshooting Focus** - Comprehensive coverage of common operational issues

## Consequences

### Positive

- Engineers can now understand the complete system without external research
- Operational procedures are documented and repeatable
- Development workflow is clearly defined
- Troubleshooting guidance reduces incident resolution time
- All guidance aligns with official upstream sources and our organizational policies

### Negative

- Documentation requires maintenance as upstream Invoice Ninja evolves
- Large documentation set requires periodic review to ensure accuracy
- Some procedures may need validation in different environments

### Maintenance Requirements

- Regular review of upstream Invoice Ninja documentation for changes
- Validation of documented procedures during upgrades
- Updates to reflect any changes in organizational image policy
- Periodic testing of troubleshooting procedures

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Minimal Documentation** - Would not meet the issue requirements for comprehensive coverage
2. **External Wiki** - Would not keep documentation within the repository as required
3. **README-only Approach** - Would not provide sufficient detail for operational use

## Implementation Notes

- All source citations include title, URL, and retrieval date as required
- No sensitive tokens or secrets are included in the documentation
- All links have been verified to ensure no dead references
- Documentation structure follows the specified requirements exactly

## Review Schedule

This documentation should be reviewed quarterly to ensure alignment with:
- Upstream Invoice Ninja changes
- Organizational policy updates  
- Operational experience and feedback
- Technology stack updates
